# Runtime Guide

This repo runs as a local polling workflow.

## Main Commands

```bash
./scripts/control-plane.sh start
./scripts/control-plane.sh stop
./scripts/control-plane.sh run --task-id TASK-123
./scripts/control-plane.sh run-next
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch --role goal
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch --role test
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch --role improve
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch --role propose
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch-all
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch-all-status
./scripts/control-plane.sh watch-all-stop
```

## Watchers

### `watch --role goal`

- polls for `task-kind: goal`
- claims work by moving it to `Running`
- runs implementation work

### `watch --role test`

- polls for `task-kind: test`
- runs verification work

### `watch --role improve`

- polls for explicit `task-kind: improve`
- also inspects `Blocked` tasks for triage

### `watch --role propose`

- runs a bounded proposal cycle when the board is sufficiently idle or recent signals justify it
- creates Plane tasks instead of executing open-ended repo changes
- uses cooldowns, quotas, and deduplication to avoid board spam
- prefers `Ready for AI` only for strong, bounded tasks; otherwise uses `Backlog`

### `watch-all`

- local convenience wrapper that launches all four lanes together
- writes separate logs and PID files
- not a scheduler cluster or distributed supervisor

## Heartbeat And Status

`watch-all-status` reports:

- whether each watcher is running
- cycle number
- last action
- current task id/task kind when present
- follow-up counts for the current session
- blocked tasks triaged for the current session
- autonomous tasks proposed for the current session
- last update time

This is the quickest way to tell whether the local system is alive or stalled.

## Logs And Artifacts

- command logs: `logs/local/`
- Plane runtime logs: `logs/local/plane-runtime/`
- watcher logs, PIDs, heartbeat files: `logs/local/watch-all/`
- retained run artifacts: `tools/report/kodo_plane/`

## Retention

```bash
./scripts/control-plane.sh janitor
```

The wrapper also runs janitor automatically before commands.

Default retention is 1 day and can be changed with:

```bash
CONTROL_PLANE_RETENTION_DAYS=<days>
```

## Runtime Boundaries

Current runtime is:

- local-first
- polling-based
- single-machine
- one watcher process per role

It is not:

- a queue
- a distributed scheduler
- a multi-host supervisor
- an unlimited autonomous planner
